# Japan Itinerary Gap Analysis & Enhancement Recommendations
## Blaalid & Rowles Families | March 7-21, 2026

## PART 1: IDENTIFIED GAPS & FRUSTRATIONS

### What's Currently Missing from Mico's Documents

| Gap Category | What's Missing | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Time Structure** | Specific departure times for trains, walking time estimates, arrival times | Without this, you're constantly calculating logistics instead of enjoying |
| **Meal Planning** | Which meals are covered vs. on-your-own, specific restaurant names | You shouldn't have to research where to eat while hungry and tired |
| **Attraction Duration** | How long to spend at each site | Can't plan a seamless day without knowing if a shrine takes 20 min or 2 hrs |
| **Hard Deadlines** | Reservation times, last entry times, transportation cutoffs | Missing a train or entry time ruins the day |
| **Decision Points** | Clear "must-do" vs "optional" designations | Too many choices creates paralysis |
| **Walking Routes** | Station exits, which direction to walk, landmarks | Wasted time figuring out navigation |

### The Core Problem
The current itinerary gives you WHAT to see but not HOW to experience it seamlessly. You need a document that eliminates day-of research entirely.

## QUESTIONS TO DECIDE AS A GROUP

1. **Tea Ceremony vs Sword Experience:** Do you want both, or choose one? MAIKOYA offers combo packages.

2. **Kimono Day:** March 15 (main Kyoto tour with Mico) or March 16 (Arashiyama)?

3. **Onitsuka Tiger Shopping:** Tokyo (Day 2 in Harajuku) or Osaka (largest store)?

4. **How much "optional" content do you want cut?** Some days have 8+ activities listed - realistically you can do 4-5 well.

5. **Restaurant pre-selection:** Do you want me to pick ONE dinner spot per day, or keep 2-3 options?
